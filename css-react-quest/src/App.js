    <h1>Nana Osaki</h1>
    <h2>Personality and traits</h2>
    <p>Nana may look like a tough Goth-punk rocker, but she has a kind heart and is a devoted friend. Abandoned by her mother and raised by her grandmother, Nana was expelled from high school after she was falsely accused of prostitution. Despite these hardships, Nana "polishes the shards of her dreams" and is determined to be successful as the lead vocalist of Blast. She is now engaged to Ren Honjo (Nana's first love), although she also has lingering, ambiguous feelings for Yasushi Takagi. Despite insisting that she wants to be independent - even being compared to "a stray cat, full of pride" by Nana Komatsu - Nana often turns to Yasu for help.
    Nana's favorite things never change. Her favorite designer is Vivienne Westwood, and her favorite band is the Sex Pistols. She smokes Seven Stars and likes coffee with milk and strawberry cake. Nana K. notes Nana O.'s favorite things never changed. Her favorite flower is the ren (lotus). She also has the ability to cook, but prepares all her food with too much salt, which only Ren seems to enjoy. Nana has a sarcastic attitude and a blunt sense of humor; she jokingly calls herself a sadist.</p>
